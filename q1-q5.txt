and to use it must be define somewhere in the scope in which you wish to call it.

2. What is a callback?

Callbacks its a a function that is passed into another function as an argument.

3. can callbacks only be used in asynchronous code?

No it could be asynchronos and synchronos it all depends where you call them at.

4. Why are javascript functions first-class citizens?

Because you can store functions in variables, pass them to other functions as arguments, and return them from other functions as values.
 
5. Explain javascript Closures?

Closures gives you access to an outer functionl's scope, it doesnt matter where the other function is created at,
 it will store all the info from that scope and carry that information over to wherever that function is being called at.

6. explain try/catch blocks

Try Block will check the code and test to see if there are any errors while its being executed.
Catch Block will define certain code to be executed ,if an error occurs in the try block.
